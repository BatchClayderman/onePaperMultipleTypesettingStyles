This is a one-paper-multiple-typesetting-styles template. With this template, users can easily switch to different LaTeX typesetting styles while maintaining up-to-date content. For example, in case a paper is unfortunately rejected without being reviewed, users can switch to a better journal or conference immediately or even directly. We hope all papers can be accepted in a suitable and satisfying place.
